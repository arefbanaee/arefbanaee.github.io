  explanation:
    "I completed my B.S. thesis under the supervision of Dr. M. Karimpour in July 2019. In this investigation I have analyzed the possibility of buckling, torsion and fatigue in tumoral components of a novel design of Total Knee Replacement Prostheses with oval sections. The forces and moments applied to the knee have been found, then a finite element model of the prosthesis was built and analyzed, using Abaqus. I am currently engaged in developing the model to make a prototype and preparing the test setups to carry out some expriments.",
