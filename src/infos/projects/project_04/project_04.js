    "Optimization of Die and Plug Profile in Cold Forward and Backward Extrusion Process",
  image: "./images/projects/project04/project04.png",
  explanation:
    "In this study the stresses in plug and die have been derived analytically then a numerical computer program has been developed to minimize these stresses by modifying the profiles of the die and plug. To verify analytical results, the process is wholly simulated using common code ANSYS. A reduction in deformation stress, an increase in tool life, and a decrease in tool wear through optimization of processes were resulted. This research was under the supervision of Dr. A. Parvizi and it currently is under the review in Journal of Material Processing Technology.",
